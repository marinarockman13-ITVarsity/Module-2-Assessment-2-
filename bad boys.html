                    <b>Synopsis:</b>Miami-Dade detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) blow a fuse when $100 million worth of heroin they recently confiscated is heisted from station headquarters. 
                    Suspecting it was an inside job, Internal Affairs gives them five days to track down the drugs before they shut down the narcotics division. 
                    Action meets farce when Marcus is compelled to masquerade as his partner in order to gain the trust of a call girl (Tea Leoni), a key witness in their investigation.
