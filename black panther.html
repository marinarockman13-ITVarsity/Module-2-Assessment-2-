                    Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.

                    <b>Cast:</b>Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:
                    The king of the African nation of Wakanda who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the heart-shaped herb.
                    Michael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik "Killmonger" Stevens:
                    A U.S. Navy SEAL in black ops who seeks to overthrow his cousin T'Challa, with his own opinion on how Wakanda should be ruled.
                    Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia:
                    T'Challa's former lover and a War Dog, an undercover spy for Wakanda, from the River Tribe.
                    Nyong'o called Nakia a "departure" from her comic counterpart. She begins the film fighting for enslaved women in Nigeria.
