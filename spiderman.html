                    Peter Parker's relaxing European vacation takes an unexpected turn when Nick Fury shows up in his hotel room to recruit him for a mission. 
                    The world is in danger as four massive elemental creatures -- each representing Earth, air, water and fire -- emerge from a hole torn in the universe.

                    <b>Cast:</b>Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
                    A high-school junior and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Director Jon Watts said that, in contrast to Spider-Man: Homecoming in which Parker longs for the responsibilities of an adult, in Far From Home he wants to hang onto his youth, saying, "This film is about the world telling him.
                    'It's time for you to step up and grow up, kid,' and he's saying, 'But I still want to be a kid and go on vacation.
                    Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:
                    The former director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who is now in a situation where he does not have the level of control he is used to having.
                    Watts describes Fury's relationship with Parker as "the mean new stepdad", contrasting his role with Tony Stark as a "supportive cool uncle" in Homecoming, saying, "Fury sees Peter Parker as an asset that he needs who is too preoccupied with a bunch of high school problems." Watts originally pitched Fury as a mentor to Parker in Homecoming.
                    Zendaya as Michelle "MJ" Jones-Watson: Parker's classmate and love interest. Her full name, Michelle Jones-Watson, is revealed in the sequel Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).
                    Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who works closely with Nick Fury.
                    Jon Favreau as Harold "Happy" Hogan:
                    The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark who looks after Parker. Watts noted Happy would be used to explore the idea of "trying to find your place in the world if the center of your world is gone" given his close friendship to Stark.
                    J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell:
                    Parker's teacher and a chaperone on his school trip to Europe. The role was written for Smoove after the writers and director enjoyed his performance alongside Holland in an Audi commercial short film produced to promote Homecoming
